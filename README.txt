This website focuses on a basic template showcasing my current skills in HTML and CSS-oriented programming.
The main HTML files in this particular project are:

1. Main
This is the home page for the website and showcases the subpages, providing previews and contexts to the page.

2. Teaching Philosophy
This page essentially focuses on my beginnings in becoming an educator and my current and future goals for my career.

3. About Me
This page goes into detail how I actually got into TAS back then in High School, providing context as to why I went into Technology teaching.

4. Contact Me
This page is rather short, however, it is a page that enables users to contact me via a form and by contacting my LinkedIn embedded profile.

Many changes were made in terms of the scripts, font family choices and colours for the website.
Other changes included images and the overall layout of the website. The nav class is also a feature that allows users to redirect themselves back to the home page or to other subpages of the website.

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.
