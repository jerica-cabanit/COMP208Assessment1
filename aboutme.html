							<h4>"Yep, here's the life story."</h4>
							<p>Picture me, a young, timid Year 7 teenager who didn't know where her strengths lie, recieving her mark on her first ever Technology Mandatory assignment on Digital Technologies.

							"Good job, you got top of the class." handing over the marking sheet to my hands. "A solid 'A' grade, full marks."
							A core memory was surely created that day. I just remember the absolute thrill and warmth of what would be my
							first feeling of academic validation. Throughout my learning in the Technology Mandatory stage, I aced each assignment,
							obtaining first place in my class in Year 7 and 8. It was in that moment that I found something I equally enjoyed and excelled at.
							I would end up choosing to Graphics Technology in Stage 5, coming hot in second to the person that I also got
							second to in my other elective. It was hard to come to terms with the fact that I couldn't reach their level and achieve similar marks.
							Granted, I still achieved high marks - and it wasn't going to stop me from choosing Industrial Technology Multimedia and Design and Technology in Year 11 and 12.
							Stage 6, I was in for ride, dealing with not one (almost three) but two major projects! And I burnt out really bad. How bad?
							I was still putting together both my major project and major design project the days they were due.
							That's how hard I fell down to the nadir of my academic career.

							<h4>Like, I really can't believe that I went through all that!</h4>

							I was stressed beyond relief to manage everything on my plate; my extra-curriculars, studying for all of my subjects, working my casual job - it was an absolute struggle sustaining my first rankings in three of my subjects when everyone knew the importance of ranking in the ATAR.
							Next thing I know, ATARs are released and it took all my willpower to even look at my phone. I came to school with a heavy heart. The culmination of my schooling came down to this moment. And I felt like I blew it.
							As soon as I walked in, a few teachers walked over my way, including my TAS teachers. Every one of them were congratulating me on my results - while I stood there dumbfounded. I asked them why they were saying what they were saying. They then looked at me with the same dumbfounded look I had.
							"Congrats Jerica." my D&T teacher said.
							She showed me her phone. And, there it was. 
							"You got band 6 in both Design & Tech and Industrial Tech."
							She smiles, grinning with joy, "We're extremely proud of you."
							I did that. By some sheer luck, I managed to get a band 6 in the technology subjects I loved the most doing.
