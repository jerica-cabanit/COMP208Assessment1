							<h2>But like, why did I become a teacher?</h2>
						</header>
						<p> I'll be honest. I frankly saw a range of different future aspirations for me.
							A mountain of expectations continuously piled up and so did my anxieties trying to choose the path that I won't regret.
							People have always seen me as a future trailblazer for the creative world, and that worried me to no end. 
							What if I burn out like I did with my major projects? What if I can't handle the struggles of the corporate and industry world?
							The workplace isn't forgiving to procrastinating perfectionists like me. <br />
							<br />
							I was running out of time. UAC rounds were getting less and less while I ended up with more and more degrees to choose from.
							I became restless; everyone else had their life together while I still was a puddled mess.
							All these future occupations that people suggested, just didn't click with me. So I asked my teachers for guidance.
							Granted, it may have not been the greatest idea but I strangely felt drawn to asking them.
							I was right in seeing that they would sugarcoat their answers, in which all of them did. <br />
							<br />
							Except one.
							<br />
							<strong>"Why don't you be a teacher?"<br />
							<br />
							I paused, redirecting my attention to their words.<br />
							<br />
							"Actually, scratch that. Don't be a teacher."</p></strong>
						<header>
							<h4>And so I took that LITERALLY</h4>
							<p>No I swear I'm actually doing it because I want to... I'm not that petty...</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Interestingly enough, being an educator was one I didn't see.
							I've always admired my teachers, well, some. Needless to say, I still admired the work and effort they all put in to teach.
							Yet, it finally filled that feeling of fullfilment that was missing, as if it was the final piece of the puzzle I was looking for all along.<br />
							<br /> As cringe as it may sound (and petty over the fact that they thought that it wouldn't be a good idea), maybe I was destined for the role of the educator.
							Fast forward to 2022, I'm having an amazing time doing the BED/BAT degree at ACU, partaking in extra-curriculars as Vice-President of the Education Society and the Creative Society and Sub-Committee of the Student Association, and eager to enter the world of being a TAS educator in a world where demand outweighs supply.
							After all, beyond all that I do, I am truly a learner with a tremendous drive to develop and improve my skills in all facets of my career.

						<h4><strong>My future goals as a TAS Teacher</strong></h4>
						<p>"Maybe I want to be the next Eddie Woo; better yet, the next revolutionary TAS teacher in the making!"</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						I like to think of my future goals on a timeline as I'm the kind of person who plans way ahead instead of planning the now.
						I suppose as a self-proclaimed 'procrastinating perfectionist', I am a walking oxymoron that has the
						ambition to achieve higher in widening my capabilities but will 100% enact on it whenever I feel like it.
						Firstly, I intend to change my procrastinating tendencies and steadily change my work ethic to be more organised than I am now.
						I find that teachers who are organised are able to effectively teach and adapt to any difficulties that may arise when teaching - which I saw in both my first practicum and in my high-school teachers.
						As previously stated, I dearly enjoyed my time with my TAS teachers mainly because they took the time to not only faciliate my learning,
						but to also reinforce the significance of the teacher and student relationship through the application of the hidden curriculum.
						I aspire to do the same with my future students, following the belief that by benefitting the relationship,
						I am able to benefit both their growth as an individual and as an academic student.

							<h4>Can you imagine young me being a teacher? Insane how life works!</h4>

									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						</section>
					<p>
						Reflecting on my identity as an openly queer individual and as a PoC, I strongly hope to use my position as a future educator
						to reinforce the need for facilitating a positive, safe and inclusive school and classroom environment for all students.
						Personally, the professional practice standard of facilitating a safe learning environment through inclusive means is the one
						I align with the most as an educator and I truly desire to enable anyone to take initiative of their
						learning.
						In a more professional context, I aim to either further my studies as an educator through a Masters of Education,
						or take the road less traveled as an educator with a Masters of Educational Leadership degree.
						And I certainly don't intend to stop just there; I hope to continue in my studies by getting into a PhD degree of Education.
						A silly, but also ambitious goal for me as an educator, is to one day be one of those educators who stand on the
						platform as a TED Ed Speaker. I can't imagine feeling both the thrill and restlessness of being able to present 
						something so amazing and revolutionary to the 21st century education world.
						I don't see this being achieved right now, but certainly, and surely, I'll be able to focus on something as huge as this as a goal.
