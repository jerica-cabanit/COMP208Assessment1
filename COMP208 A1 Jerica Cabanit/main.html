				<h2>Okay, So, who are you, actually?</h2>

				<p> That's such a good question! <br />
				<br />
				Hi! I’m Jerica, a 3rd-year Secondary Education and Technologies student at ACU. ✨
				
				I currently volunteer for an assortment of groups and organisations, both in and out of university with varying
				leadership and committee responsibilities.
				In my free time, I love to be creative with a variety of media, art and textiles.
				<br /> 
				Beyond all that I do, at my core, I am truly a learner with a
				tremendous drive to develop and improve my skills in all facets of my career.
				I intend to pursue a future in educational leadership,
				reshaping the way we teach and promote Technology and Applied Studies (TAS) in the 21st Century classroom. 
				<br />
				I believe young people are truly changemakers in all they do.
				<br />
				And I’m ready to facilitate that change.

							<h3>Rita Pierson: Every kid needs a champion</h3>
							<p>Rita Pierson, a teacher for 40 years, once heard a colleague say, "They don't pay me to like the kids." Her response: "Kids don't learn from people they don't like.'" A rousing call to educators to believe in their students and actually connect with them on a real, human, personal level.</p>
